## GradeCalc

GradeCalc is my first personal C# project. I'm using it to learn more about C# and about object orientated-programming in general.
The purpose of this program is to store grades and calculate their average.

### Details
GradeCalc is made of 3 parts
- The main cs file which isn't much but the shell for this application
- The table-class which is the base for my grade storage
- The CLI class which basically makes the table-class available to the user on terminal level.
