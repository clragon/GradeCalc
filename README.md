## GradeCalc

This is my first personal C# project. I'm using it to learn more about C# and about object-orientated programming in general.
The purpose of this program is to store my grades and calculate their average.

### Details
GradeCalc is made of three essential parts:
- The [GradeCalc](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradeCalc/GradeCalc.cs) class which is but the shell for this application.
- The [Table](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesTable/GradesTable.cs) class which is the base for my grade-storage.
- The [CLI](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesCli/GradesCli.cs) class which makes the Table class available to the user on terminal level.


### Notice
This project is focused on the grading system in Switzerland. It can work with other grading systems but keep in mind it wasn't primarily intended to do so.

Feel free to use it under the provided [license](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/LICENSE).
I welcome any pull request, issue or suggestion.
