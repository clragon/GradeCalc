## GradeCalc

GradeCalc is my first personal C# project. I'm using it to learn more about C# and about object orientated-programming in general.
The purpose of this program is to store and calculate my grades for me. 

### Compilation

Currently I'm using msbuild `csproj` files and a bash script to compile my assembly. 
To compile it for yourself, clone the repository and run the bash script on a linux machine that has [`mono-complete`](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) installed.
If you are on a Windows machine, you can build the `csproj` files manully.
