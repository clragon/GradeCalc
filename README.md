## GradeCalc

This is my first personal C# project. I'm using it to learn more about C# and about object-orientated programming in general.
The purpose of this program is to store my grades and calculate their average.

### Details
GradeCalc is made of essential 3 parts
- The [GradeCalc](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradeCalc/GradeCalc.cs) class which is but the shell for this application.
- The [Table](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesTable/GradesTable.cs) class which is the base for my grade storage.
- The [CLI](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesCli/GradesCli.cs) class which makes the Table class available to the user on terminal level.


### Notice
This project is focused on the grade system in switzerland. It _can_ calulate with other grade-systems but keep in mind it wsn't primarily intended to do so. 

Feel free to use it under the provided [license](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/LICENSE).
Furthermore I welcome any pull requests, issues or suggestions that would improve the project in this or any regard.
