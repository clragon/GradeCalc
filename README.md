## GradeCalc

This is my first personal C# project. I'm using it to learn more about C# and about object orientated-programming in general.
The purpose of this program is to store my grades and calculate their average.

### Details
GradeCalc is made of essential 3 parts
- The [GradeCalc](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradeCalc/GradeCalc.cs) cs file which is but the shell for this application.
- The [Table](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesTable/GradesTable.cs) class which is the base for my grade storage.
- The [CLI](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/GradesCli/GradesCli.cs) class which makes the Table class available to the user on terminal level.


### Notice
The Table class is written for the grade system used in Switzerland.

Therefore this project will probably not be useful to you, but feel free to clone it or use my code otherwhise under the [license](https://github.com/clragon/GradeCalc/blob/master/LICENSE) provided.
